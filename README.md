Why longitudinal data analysis?

Crossectional data analysis vs Continuous data analysis (measuring): 
Longitudinal data analysis using continuous variables:for example the blood pressure level after five different treatments and placebo. The response here is the continous. 


Proc mixed for fiting the longitudinal varaible.
Evaluate the covaraince strucuture: 
Model development: determining the heterogenity in the covaraince paramters, evaluating the covariance parameters, evaluating the fixed effects, and interactions
Random coeffient models


Longitudinal Data Analysis with Discrete Responses (counting): 
Binary response: Fitting Models with Binary Responses in PROC GLIMMIX, Using the Sandwich Estimator in PROC GLIMMIX
Oridnay response: Fitting Generalized Linear Mixed Models with an Ordinal neralized Linear Mixed Models with an Ordinal ResponseResponse, 
Fitting Generalized Linear Mixed Models with Splines
