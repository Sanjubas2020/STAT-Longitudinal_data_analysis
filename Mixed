What is mixed models? Fixed effects (three varieties of rice) and random effects (four locations).
Response: Yield

Both mixed model using proc mix and proc glimmix can be used.
Examples of mixed models: Two way mixed model,nested mixed models, split plots design, crossover design
Repeated measures data analysis
 
STAT-Stat
Why longitudinal data analysis?

Crossectional data analysis vs Continuous data analysis (measuring): Longitudinal data analysis using continuous variables:for example the blood pressure level after five different treatments and placebo. The response here is the continous.

Proc mixed for fiting the longitudinal varaible. Evaluate the covaraince strucuture: Model development: determining the heterogenity in the covaraince paramters, evaluating the covariance parameters, evaluating the fixed effects, and interactions Random coeffient models

Longitudinal Data Analysis with Discrete Responses (counting): Binary response: Fitting Models with Binary Responses in PROC GLIMMIX, Using the Sandwich Estimator in PROC GLIMMIX Oridnay response: Fitting Generalized Linear Mixed Models with an Ordinal neralized Linear Mixed Models with an Ordinal ResponseResponse, Fitting Generalized Linear Mixed Models with Splines
